## Overview
This project demonstrates credit risk analysis for customers using DAX formulas and Power BI. It focuses on customer segmentation based on credit scores and other relevant attributes.

## Project Structure
- `Data/` - Contains the dataset used for analysis.
- `DAX/` - Contains DAX formulas for risk segmentation and calculations.
- `Scripts/` - Python or SQL scripts for data preprocessing and analysis.

## Customer Risk Segmentation
- **Low Risk:** Score 700+
- **Medium Risk:** Score 600–699
- **High Risk:** Score <600

## Marital Status Analysis
DAX formulas are included to categorize customers based on their marital status.

## How to Use
1. Load the dataset into Power BI or Excel.
2. Use the DAX formulas from `DAX/` folder for analysis.
3. Optional: Run Python scripts in `Scripts/` folder for preprocessing.

## Future Improvements
- Add visualization dashboards
- Implement predictive credit scoring models
